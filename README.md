.dbo-converter
==============

The Dark Basic Object format has been first described by TheGameCreators in 2003 and their products (FPS Creator & Dark Basic / Dark Basic Pro) have been supporting it till this point. Sadly there are not alot of (good) converters out there. 
I started a very small .dbo converter, at this stage it doesn't actually convert anything (just started working on it), it just reads a .dbo file into it's memory.
I am planning to support an easy xml ouput format first, either: .irrmesh, .mesh or .dae. Hopefully by making this code public, future contributions coud lead in support for more formats.
